## Funding

This project is currently running on the Henhen1227 servers. 

To fund this project, please consider donating [here](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/henryabrahamsen/membership). 

I've been eyeing the domain **SPSNow.app** which costs $30 USD per year.
If interest is high enough, or if I get enough donations, I will purchase the domain and move the project over to it.


## Maintenance

I will graduate soon, so I'm hoping the Computer Science Club will continue to maintain this project.
